#Cascade Delete Exercise:
#(Source: GeeksforGeeks)

#Run following queries

Create datbase Casdel1;

Use casdel1;

CREATE TABLE Student (sno INT PRIMARY KEY, sname VARCHAR(20), age INT);

INSERT INTO Student(sno, sname,age) VALUES(1,'Ankit',17), (2,'Ramya',18), 
(3,'Ram',16);

CREATE TABLE Course (cno INT PRIMARY KEY, cname VARCHAR(20));

INSERT INTO Course(cno, cname) VALUES(101,'c'),(102,'c++'),(103,'DBMS');

CREATE TABLE Enroll (sno INT,cno INT,jdate date, PRIMARY KEY(sno,cno),
FOREIGN KEY(sno) REFERENCES Student(sno) ON DELETE CASCADE, 
FOREIGN KEY(cno) REFERENCES Course(cno) ON DELETE CASCADE);


INSERT INTO Enroll(sno,cno,jdate) VALUES(1, 101, '2021-06-05'), (1, 102, '2021-06-04'), (2, 103, '2021-06-03');

#delete from any on of parent table
DELETE FROM Student WHERE sname="Ramya";

#Now display content of child table - Enroll
select * from enroll;
#observe the output and understand effect of cascade delete on child table.


Dont consider below queries for excercise:

SELECT table_name FROM referential_constraints  
WHERE constraint_schema = 'database_name'  
        AND referenced_table_name = 'parent_table'  
        AND delete_rule = 'CASCADE'  


SELECT table_name FROM referential_constraints  
WHERE constraint_schema = 'casdel'  
        AND referenced_table_name = 'Student'  
        AND delete_rule = 'CASCADE';
